In this post, we will see how to create a Pull Request on GitHub.

> For this example, I will be making a PR to the [discord assistant](https://github.com/hackarmour/discord-assistant) of [Hack Armour](https://hackarmour.tech).

### Fork the repository

First step, fork the repository.

### Clone the forked repository

Clone the forked repo locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/{user}/{repoName}.git
```

### Switch branch

Usually you don't want to mess with the main/master branch.
Switch branches before adding your changes.

```bash
$ git checkout -b {branchName}
```

Some pointers for naming the branch:

1. Use your username:
   Using your username ensures that your changes don't
   conflict with other branches.
   (e.g.) `mrnightdev-patch-5`

2. Include the name of the feature:
   For example let's say I am adding a moderation feature,
   `add-mod-cmds` could be a way to name my branch.

### Commit the changes

Make the necessary changes and commit them.

```bash
$ git add . # This tells git to stage your changes.
$ git commit -m "Your message here"
$ git push # Push your changes to the forked repo
```

If you created a new branch locally, you will need to set
the local branch to fetch its upstream from GitHub.

```bash
$ git remote
origin
$ git push -u origin {branchName} # replace origin with the name of your remote
```

### Creating the pull request

Open your forked repo on GitHub.
