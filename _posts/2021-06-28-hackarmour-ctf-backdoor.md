## Visiting the website

![the website](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrnightdev/blog-images@master/2021/06/backdoor/01-website.png)

We can see that the website uses php version `8.1.0-dev`.

## A little backstory

This version was released with a backdoor in March 2021 when two malicious commits were pushed to to the php source repo. You can read the announcement [here](https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/113838).

## About the Vulnerability

If we add a header to the request `User Agentt: zerodiumsystem('ls')`,
the server executes the command `ls`.

## Exploit

Start Burp Suite and capture the request.

![Captured Request](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrnightdev/blog-images@master/2021/06/backdoor/02-burp_req.png)

~~Yes I am on Windows :/~~

We are told the flag is in `/opt/flag.txt`. So let us add the header

```cmd
User Agentt: zerodiumsystem('cat /opt/flag.txt');
```

and forward the request.

![Modified Request](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrnightdev/blog-images@master/2021/06/backdoor/03-modified-req.png)

And voil√†! We see the flag in the response.

PHP should really check their PRs, don't they? ;)
